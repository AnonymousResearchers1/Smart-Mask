To fabricate the transmitter and reciever:
1. Intrface CCS811 sensor to a nRF5820 based microcontroller
2. Upload the transmitter code to the above setup
3. Upload the reciever code to another nRF5820 based microcontroller 
4. Add "ArduSpreadsheet" tool to your Arduino IDE for easy data logging as .csv file
